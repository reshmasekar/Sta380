```{r,echo=TRUE}
# Association rule mining
# Adapted from code by Matt Taddy
library('arules')  # has a big ecosystem of packages built around it

# Read in playlists from users
groceries <- read.csv("~/Desktop/STA380-master/data/groceries.txt")


# First create a list of baskets: vectors of items by consumer
# Analagous to bags of words

# First split data into a list of artists for each user
groceries <- split(groceries,f=",")
## Remove duplicates ("de-dupe")
groceries <- lapply(groceries, unique)

## Cast this variable as a special arules "transactions" class.
groceriestrans <- read.transactions("~/Desktop/STA380-master/data/groceries.txt",format=c("basket"),sep=",",encoding="unknown",rm.duplicates=TRUE)
# Now run the 'apriori' algorithm
# Look at rules with support > .01 & confidence >.5 & length (# artists) <= 4
grocrules <- apriori(groceriestrans, 
                     parameter=list(support=.01, confidence=.5, maxlen=4))
#detach(package:tm, unload)=TRUE                    
# Look at the output
inspect(grocrules)

## Choose a subset
inspect(subset(grocrules, subset=support > .01 & confidence > 0.55))

```
From the above we can infer that whole milk is brought very often in combination with curd, yoghurt and
butter and vegetables, eggs and vegetables and other vegetables are brought a lot often in 
combination with root vegetables and fruits
